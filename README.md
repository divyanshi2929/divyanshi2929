## 💫 About Me:
I’m a Computer Science student who enjoys building practical AI systems using Python, Machine Learning, and Generative AI. I like turning ideas into real projects, from training models to deploying them as usable applications. Currently, I’m exploring LLMs, AI agents, and scalable backend design while continuously improving my problem-solving skills.
